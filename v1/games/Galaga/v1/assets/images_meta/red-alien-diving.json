  "description": "The red alien enemy in an aggressive diving attack pose, body angled diagonally downward to show attacking motion. Wings are swept back dynamically and the overall design conveys rapid descent toward the player position. Maintains the red color scheme but with more aggressive, dynamic positioning compared to the idle formation state. Sharp angles emphasize the threatening nature of the diving attack.",
