  "description": "A small, sleek fighter spacecraft facing upward in classic arcade pixel art style. The ship has a triangular body with a bright white/silver color scheme and blue engine glow at the bottom. Features angular wings spread horizontally and a pointed nose cone. The design is reminiscent of 1980s arcade games with clean, geometric lines and high contrast against dark backgrounds. Size fits a 32x32 pixel grid with the ship oriented vertically, nose pointing up for upward movement and shooting.",
